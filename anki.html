    <p>"Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods,
    you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn."</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>In my own experience, Anki has helped build and reinforce vocabulary and has been one of my main sources of learnng languages for several years. Anki is a flashcard program which utilizes a spaced repitition system; meaning that cards that you grasp easier will be tested less often than cards that you have struggled with. Anki is also available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki" target="_none">android.</a></p>
